# Project Overview

Ashen is a modern social networking application developed as the creator’s first major project. The name "Ashen" begins with the letter A, chosen symbolically to represent a fresh beginning and ambition for this to be the first in a series of impactful applications.
The app's primary purpose is to connect users around the world through intuitive design, real-time interaction, and modern web technologies.

## What the App Does

Ashen allows users to:

Create and customize personal profiles

Post content with images

Like and comment on other users’ posts

Follow other users

Manage their own content and interactions

The focus is on delivering a smooth, fast, and clean user experience.

## Technologies Used

The development of Ashen was powered by the following technologies and libraries:

React (with libraries such as react-dropzone, react-dom, etc.)

TypeScript – for static typing and safer code

AppWrite – for user authentication, database, storage, and backend logic

TanStack Query (React Query) – for server-state management and data fetching

Tailwind CSS – for utility-first and responsive styling

ShadCN/UI – for clean, reusable UI components

various additional helper libraries (e.g., Zod, Lucide Icons, Framer Motion...)

## Special Thanks

A special thank you to my mentor Igor Ostojić, whose guidance, knowledge, and support were essential throughout the development of this project.
