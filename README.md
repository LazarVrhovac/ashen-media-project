# Project Overview

Ashen is a modern social networking application developed as the creatorâ€™s first major project. The name "Ashen" begins with the letter A, chosen symbolically to represent a fresh beginning and ambition for this to be the first in a series of impactful applications.
The app's primary purpose is to connect users around the world through intuitive design, real-time interaction, and modern web technologies.

## What the App Does

Ashen allows users to:

- Create and customize personal profiles

- Post content with images

- Like other usersâ€™ posts

- Manage their own content and interactions

- The focus is on delivering a smooth, fast, and clean user experience.

## Technologies Used

- React (with libraries such as react-dropzone, react-dom, etc.)

- TypeScript â€“ for static typing and safer code

- AppWrite â€“ for user authentication, database, storage, and backend logic

- TanStack Query (React Query) â€“ for server-state management and data fetching

- Tailwind CSS â€“ for utility-first and responsive styling

- ShadCN/UI â€“ for clean, reusable UI components

- - Various additional helper libraries (e.g., Zod, Lucide Icons, Framer Motion...)

- `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` â€“ Provides authentication state and methods (e.g. login, logout) via React Context to be used across the app.
- `src/lib/validation/utils.ts` â€“ Contains utility functions for validating form inputs and user data before submission.
- `src/lib/appwrite/api.ts` â€“ Defines API functions that interact with the Appwrite backend (e.g. fetching data, creating or deleting records).
